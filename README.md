# 👋 Hi, I'm Walid

I’m currently learning **AI / Machine Learning** and sharing my learning journey here on GitHub.  
This profile is where I practice, build small projects, and improve step by step.

# 🐍 Quick Intro
```python
class WalidAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "AI Developer"
        self.stack = ["Python", "NumPy", "Pandas", "PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "Streamlit"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Hi 👋 I'm Walid, I build AI models and apps!")

me = WalidAI()
me.say_hi()
